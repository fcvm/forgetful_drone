  title        = {Deep Drone Racing: Learning Agile Flight in Dynamic Environments},
  abstract     = {Autonomous agile flight brings up fundamental challenges in robotics, such as coping with unreliable state estimation, reacting optimally to dynamically changing environments, and coupling perception and action in real time under severe resource constraints. In this paper, we consider these challenges in the context of autonomous, vision-based drone racing in dynamic environments. Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a state-of-the-art path-planning and control system. The CNN directly maps raw images into a robust representation in the form of a waypoint and desired speed. This information is then used by the planner to generate a short, minimum-jerk trajectory segment and corresponding motor commands to reach the desired goal. We demonstrate our method in autonomous agile flight scenarios, in which a vision-based quadrotor traverses drone-racing tracks with possibly moving gates. Our method does not require any explicit map of the environment and runs fully onboard. We extensively test the precision and robustness of the approach in simulation and in the physical world. We also evaluate our method against state-of-the-art navigation approaches and professional human drone pilots.},

  abstract    = {Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising and powerful technique for automatically acquiring control policies that can process raw sensory inputs, such as images, and perform complex behaviors. However, extending deep RL to real-world robotic tasks has proven challenging, particularly in safety-critical domains such as autonomous flight, where a trial-and-error learning process is often impractical. In this paper, we explore the following question: can we train vision-based navigation policies entirely in simulation, and then transfer them into the real world to achieve real-world flight without a single real training image? We propose a learning method that we call CAD$^2$RL, which can be used to perform collision-free indoor flight in the real world while being trained entirely on 3D CAD models. Our method uses single RGB images from a monocular camera, without needing to explicitly reconstruct the 3D geometry of the environment or perform explicit motion planning. Our learned collision avoidance policy is represented by a deep convolutional neural network that directly processes raw monocular images and outputs velocity commands. This policy is trained entirely on simulated images, with a Monte Carlo policy evaluation algorithm that directly optimizes the network's ability to produce collision-free flight. By highly randomizing the rendering settings for our simulated training set, we show that we can train a policy that generalizes to the real world, without requiring the simulator to be particularly realistic or high-fidelity. We evaluate our method by flying a real quadrotor through indoor environments, and further evaluate the design choices in our simulator through a series of ablation studies on depth prediction.

  abstract    = {We introduce CARLA, an open-source simulator for autonomous driving research. CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous urban driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions. We use CARLA to study the performance of three approaches to autonomous driving: a classic modular pipeline, an end-to-end model trained via imitation learning, and an end-to-end model trained via reinforcement learning. The approaches are evaluated in controlled scenarios of increasing difficulty, and their performance is examined via metrics provided by CARLA, illustrating the platform's utility for autonomous driving research.

  abstract    = {This work explores the feasibility of steering a drone with a (recurrent) neural network, based on input from a forward looking camera, in the context of a high-level navigation task. We set up a generic framework for training a network to perform navigation tasks based on imitation learning. It can be applied to both aerial and land vehicles. As a proof of concept we apply it to a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in a simulated environment, learning to cross a room containing a number of obstacles. So far only feedforward neural networks (FNNs) have been used to train UAV control. To cope with more complex tasks, we propose the use of recurrent neural networks (RNN) instead and successfully train an LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) network for controlling UAVs. Vision based control is a sequential prediction problem, known for its highly correlated input data. The correlation makes training a network hard, especially an RNN. To overcome this issue, we investigate an alternative sampling method during training, namely window-wise truncated backpropagation through time (WW-TBPTT). Further, end-to-end training requires a lot of data which often is not available. Therefore, we compare the performance of retraining only the Fully Connected (FC) and LSTM control layers with networks which are trained end-to-end. Performing the relatively simple task of crossing a room already reveals important guidelines and good practices for training neural control networks. Different visualizations help to explain the behavior learned.},
