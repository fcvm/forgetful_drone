%The concept of commercial UAV delivery started in 2013 when Amazon announced the initiative "Amazon Prime Air"\cite{AmazonPrimeAir}
%to develope UAV systems for parcel delivery.\cite{Manjoo2016}
%Within less than a week, UPS reacted on the plans of Amazon to enter the core business of UPS by announcing own plans for UAV delivery.\cite{Hessinger2013}
%Nevertheless, in the shadow of these gigantic companies, in July 2015 Flirtey, an Australian start-up, 
%conducted the first federally-approved commercial UAV delivery in the United States.\cite{Flirtey2015}
%Thereupon, in July 2016 Flirtey in corporation with 7-Eleven, a large internationally operating chain of convenience stores, 
%performed the first "store-to-door" UAV deliveries to private customers in the US with an autonomously flying drone relying on precision GPS.\cite{PostnParcel}
%October 2016 Zipline
%In December 2016, Amazon caught up with its first UAV delivery in the United Kingdom \cite{Amazon2016},
%where legal regulations with respect to autonomously flying UAVs are less restrictive than in the United States. \cite{DailyCaller2017}
%In August 2017,  Aha in corporation with Flytrex, start-ups from Iceland and Israel, respectively, 
%launched a project to fly drones manufactured by DJI on preprogrammed missions to deliver consumer goods to customers' houses in Rejkjavik, the capital of Iceland. 
%Iceland previously relaxed necessary regulations for this project.\cite{Ross2018}
