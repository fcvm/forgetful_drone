  abstract        = {An algorithm is proposed allowing for the rapid generation and evaluation of quadrocopter state interception trajectories. These trajectories are from arbitrary initial states to final states defined by the vehicle position, velocity and acceleration with a specified end of time. Sufficient criteria are then derived allowing trajectories to be tested for feasibility with respect to thrust and body rates. It is also shown that the range of a linear combination of the vehicle state can be solved for in closed form, useful e.g. for testing that the position remains within a box. The algorithm is applied by revisiting the problem of finding a trajectory to hit a ball towards a target with a racket attached to a quadrocopter. The trajectory generator is used in a model predictive control like strategy, where thousands of trajectories are generated and evaluated at every controller update step, with the first input of the optimal trajectory being sent to the vehicle. It is shown that the method can generate and evaluate on the order of one million trajectories per second on a standard laptop computer.},

  abstract      = {When a large feedforward neural network is trained on a small training set, it typically performs poorly on held-out test data. This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

  abstract      = {Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},
