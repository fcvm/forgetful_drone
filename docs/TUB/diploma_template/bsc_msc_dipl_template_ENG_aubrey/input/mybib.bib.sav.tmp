  abstract        = {An algorithm is proposed allowing for the rapid generation and evaluation of quadrocopter state interception trajectories. These trajectories are from arbitrary initial states to final states defined by the vehicle position, velocity and acceleration with a specified end of time. Sufficient criteria are then derived allowing trajectories to be tested for feasibility with respect to thrust and body rates. It is also shown that the range of a linear combination of the vehicle state can be solved for in closed form, useful e.g. for testing that the position remains within a box. The algorithm is applied by revisiting the problem of finding a trajectory to hit a ball towards a target with a racket attached to a quadrocopter. The trajectory generator is used in a model predictive control like strategy, where thousands of trajectories are generated and evaluated at every controller update step, with the first input of the optimal trajectory being sent to the vehicle. It is shown that the method can generate and evaluate on the order of one million trajectories per second on a standard laptop computer.},

  abstract      = {When a large feedforward neural network is trained on a small training set, it typically performs poorly on held-out test data. This "overfitting" is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random "dropout" gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.},

  abstract      = {Neural machine translation is a relatively new approach to statistical machine translation based purely on neural networks. The neural machine translation models often consist of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder extracts a fixed-length representation from a variable-length input sentence, and the decoder generates a correct translation from this representation. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the properties of the neural machine translation using two models; RNN Encoder--Decoder and a newly proposed gated recursive convolutional neural network. We show that the neural machine translation performs relatively well on short sentences without unknown words, but its performance degrades rapidly as the length of the sentence and the number of unknown words increase. Furthermore, we find that the proposed gated recursive convolutional network learns a grammatical structure of a sentence automatically.},

In this work, we propose a novel quadrotor simulator: Flightmare. Flightmare is composed of two main components: a configurable rendering engine built on Unity and a flexible physics engine for dynamics simulation. Those two components are totally decoupled and can run independently of each other. This makes our simulator extremely fast: rendering achieves speeds of up to 230 Hz, while physics simulation of up to 200,000 Hz on a laptop. In addition, Flightmare comes with several desirable features: (i) a large multi-modal sensor suite, including an interface to extract the 3D point-cloud of the scene; (ii) an API for reinforcement learning which can simulate hundreds of quadrotors in parallel; and (iii) integration with a virtual-reality headset for interaction with the simulated environment. We demonstrate the flexibility of Flightmare by using it for two different robotic tasks: quadrotor control using deep reinforcement learning and collision-free path planning in a complex 3D environment.},

  title         = {CAD2RL: Real Single-Image Flight without a Single Real Image},
  year          = {2016},
  month         = nov,
  abstract      = {Deep reinforcement learning has emerged as a promising and powerful technique for automatically acquiring control policies that can process raw sensory inputs, such as images, and perform complex behaviors. However, extending deep RL to real-world robotic tasks has proven challenging, particularly in safety-critical domains such as autonomous flight, where a trial-and-error learning process is often impractical. In this paper, we explore the following question: can we train vision-based navigation policies entirely in simulation, and then transfer them into the real world to achieve real-world flight without a single real training image? We propose a learning method that we call CAD$^2$RL, which can be used to perform collision-free indoor flight in the real world while being trained entirely on 3D CAD models. Our method uses single RGB images from a monocular camera, without needing to explicitly reconstruct the 3D geometry of the environment or perform explicit motion planning. Our learned collision avoidance policy is represented by a deep convolutional neural network that directly processes raw monocular images and outputs velocity commands. This policy is trained entirely on simulated images, with a Monte Carlo policy evaluation algorithm that directly optimizes the network's ability to produce collision-free flight. By highly randomizing the rendering settings for our simulated training set, we show that we can train a policy that generalizes to the real world, without requiring the simulator to be particularly realistic or high-fidelity. We evaluate our method by flying a real quadrotor through indoor environments, and further evaluate the design choices in our simulator through a series of ablation studies on depth prediction.

CARLA has been developed from the ground up to support development, training, and validation of autonomous urban driving systems. In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions. We use CARLA to study the performance of three approaches to autonomous driving: a classic modular pipeline, an end-to-end model trained via imitation learning, and an end-to-end model trained via reinforcement learning. The approaches are evaluated in controlled scenarios of increasing difficulty, and their performance is examined via metrics provided by CARLA, illustrating the platform's utility for autonomous driving research.

  abstract      = {This work explores the feasibility of steering a drone with a (recurrent) neural network, based on input from a forward looking camera, in the context of a high-level navigation task. We set up a generic framework for training a network to perform navigation tasks based on imitation learning. It can be applied to both aerial and land vehicles. As a proof of concept we apply it to a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) in a simulated environment, learning to cross a room containing a number of obstacles. So far only feedforward neural networks (FNNs) have been used to train UAV control. To cope with more complex tasks, we propose the use of recurrent neural networks (RNN) instead and successfully train an LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) network for controlling UAVs. Vision based control is a sequential prediction problem, known for its highly correlated input data. The correlation makes training a network hard, especially an RNN. To overcome this issue, we investigate an alternative sampling method during training, namely window-wise truncated backpropagation through time (WW-TBPTT). Further, end-to-end training requires a lot of data which often is not available. Therefore, we compare the performance of retraining only the Fully Connected (FC) and LSTM control layers with networks which are trained end-to-end. Performing the relatively simple task of crossing a room already reveals important guidelines and good practices for training neural control networks. Different visualizations help to explain the behavior learned.},
